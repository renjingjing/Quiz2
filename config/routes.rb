Rails.application.routes.draw do
# this will match a GET request to "/hello"
# thenit will invoke the WelcomeController with hello action
# VERB "URL" => "CONTROLLER_NAME#ACTION"
# get "/hello" => "welcome#hello"

# this will match any url that has /hello/ANYTHING to WelcomeController
# hello action. Rails will also add a key value to the params Hash from
# the URL. For instance if I go to: /hello/tam the params Hash will look like:
# {"name" => "tam"}
# The as: option defines the PATH/URL helper for this route. Sometimes Rails
# doesn't automatically assign the PATH/URL helper if there is a parameter
# in the URL
# this makes it that when we visit the home page of our application. It will
# invoke the welcome_controller with index action (method) inside it
# notice the class name is WelcomeController but I only had to put welcome
# in here as "controller" part is implied

# this will match a GET request with URL "/questions/new"
# to the questions controller with new action
# The "as" option gives us a conventient method that we can use in the views
# to generate this path or url. So in my view files I can do:
# new_question_path or new_question_url
# get "/questions/new" => "questions#new", as: :new_question

# this will match a POST request with url "/questions"
# to the questions controller with create action
# post "/questions" => "questions#create", as: :questions


# this will match any GET request with "/questions/something"
# the "something" could be anything. In this case we expect it
# to be an id of the question. We will get this id in our our controller
# as part of the params object.
# the as: :question option enables us to have a helper method like:
# question_path or question_url
# get "/questions/:id" => "questions#show", as: :question

# get "/questions" => "questions#index"

# get "/questions/:id/edit" => "questions#edit", as: :edit_question

# patch "/questions/:id" => "questions#update"

# delete "/questions/:id" => "questions#destroy"
root "myideas#index"

resources :myideas do
  # this will make the answers routes have a prefix /questions/:question_id
  resources :comments, only: [:create, :destroy]

  resources :likes, only: [:index, :create, :destroy]

  resources :collaborations, only: [:index, :create, :destroy]

end


resources :users, except: [:edit, :update] do
  # this will give a URL /users/edit because we don't need the id of the user
  # in the URL because we have it in the session. In addition, it could pose
  # a security risk to have the user id part of the URL
  # as: :collection option makes it not include :id in the URL
  get :edit, on: :collection

  patch :update, on: :collection

end

resources :sessions, only: [:new, :create] do
  # this will make the destry action not requie an id so we can access
  # the destroy action with sessions_path or /sessions without passing an id
  delete :destroy, on: :collection
end

  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  # root 'welcome#index'

  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'
  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
end
