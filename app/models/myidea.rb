# adding validations in here ensures that the records meets those
# criteria before saving / creating / updating. For instance
# the record will not insert in the database in here if the title
# is not present. Passing a Hash to the validation key overrides
# the default values. So in here the message for presence validation
# will be "must be provided" instead of "can't be blank"
# validates(:title, {presence: {message: "must be provided"}, uniqueness: true, length: {minimum: 5}})
