  # @current_user variable. The second time, it won't be set, it will use it.
  # the @current_user will last for the whole request cycle.
  # we use find_by_id because it won't throw an exception if the user_id
  # doesn't exist in the database. It just give us nil which means the user
  # is not signed in.
